____________________|

    The module can only be defined by creating 'module-info.java' file


    Keywords:

        1) requires
                - by using requires, the module is 'importing' other module's classes

        2) exports
                - it means that module is making itself 'public' to other modules

        3) exports module to other_module
                - exports itself only to specified modules

        4) requires transitive
                - suppose hello creates a subclass of some class that is in text module.
                  Then, when other modules require hello, they will explicitly require text too
